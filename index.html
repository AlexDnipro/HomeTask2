        <p>Abstract expressionism is a post–WW II art movement in American painting, developed in New York in the 1940s.</br>
           It was the first specifically American movement to achieve international influence and put New York City at the center</br>
           of the western art world, a role formerly filled by Paris.</p>

        <h2>So why America became the new center for world art?</h2>
        <p>During the period leading up to and during World War II, modernist artists, writers, and poets, as well as important collectors</br>
           and dealers, fled Europe and the onslaught of the Nazis for safe haven in the United States. Many of those who didn't flee perished.</br>
           Among the artists and collectors who arrived in New York during the war (some with help from Varian Fry) were Hans Namuth, Yves Tanguy,</br>
           Kay Sage, Max Ernst, Jimmy Ernst, Peggy Guggenheim, Leo Castelli, Marcel Duchamp, André Masson, André Breton, Marc Chagall,</br>
           Fernand Léger, and Piet Mondrian. A few artists, notably Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, and Pierre Bonnard remained in France and survived.

        <h2>Abstract expressionism painting technics</h2>
        <p>The main idea was spontaneous activity or "action" of the painter, through arm and wrist movement: gestures, brushstrokes, thrown paint, splashed or dripped.<br/>
        Subconcious expression, so called "action painting."<br/>
        During the late 1940s, Jackson Pollock's radical approach to painting revolutionized the potential for all Contemporary art that followed him.</p>
